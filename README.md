OneTwoDo is the only desktop application you need for managing your tasks.

The interface is simple and the clean GUI separates tasks into 3 categories:
    * Deadline - a task with an end date but no start dat
    * Event - a task with a start and end date
    * To do - a task without a start or end date

Its CLI interface is intended for users who are skilled at typing, and most commands are given through the command line.

    * Support for *Build Automation* using Gradle and for *Continuous Integration* using Travis CI.
