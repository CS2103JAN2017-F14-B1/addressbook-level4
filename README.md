Having trouble keeping up with the tasks you have to complete? OneTwoDo is the only task manager you need to plan your day with effectively.

The interface is simple and the clean GUI helps you separate tasks into 3  categories depending on their start and end dates, if any. OneTwoDo helps you visualize and keep track of how many tasks you have completed.

The Command Line Interface is designed for users who are skilled at typing, and most commands are given through the command line, so that those who can type fast are able to manage their tasks using the least number of steps.
